Finish stopwatch
    DONE? register for clicks from the watchface
    DONE? make the watchface to get an update from us when our state changes

    Notification / activity / menu choices
        TODO "MediaStyle" notification with buttons (actions -> pending intents -> our notification service)
        TODO Use of chronometer feature

	TODO NotificationListenerService: requests to bind and unbind when there's nothing worth listening to (eg, when we have no active complications)
	TODO setColor for tinting (different for stopwatch / timer)
	DONE? Add BroadcastReceiver for boot-completed and results from pending intents
	TODO manifest.xml with all the trimmings

	TODO set desired order of complications (small, big, icon-only, etc.)

Add timer support
    DONE? port over the StopwatchState to fit the new world order
    DONE? make the watchface to get an update from us when our state changes
    TODO time picker fragment
    TODO verify whether Wear 2.0 has a time picker that actually works
    TODO yet another notification / activity / menu choices
    DONE? figure out how to set an alarm
    DONE? make sure we can kill alarms when a complication is deregistered

Add preferences saving?
    DONE? dump all SharedState instances so they can be restored later?
    DONE? how do we know when we're being restored?
    -- in theory, we're just a normal service, so we can have onCreate and onDestroy

Lifecyle goodies
    Two sorts of services: NotificationService and *ProviderService; both now will restore state, if necessary
    TODO who actually gets killed when?
    TODO verify that notification update pipeline (which roundtrips with the watchface) actually works

i18n/l10n
    TODO bug friends again for i18n text
    TODO RTOL support?
