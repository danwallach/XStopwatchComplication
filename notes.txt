Finish stopwatch
    DONE? register for clicks from the watchface
    DONE? make the watchface to get an update from us when our state changes

    DONE? build layout for stopwatch activity
      DONE? activity listed in manifest
      DONE? only one at a time: infrastructure to kill the old ones!

    TODO ripples don't go away?!
    TODO 60hz animation, crawl progress bar thing on 60-sec schedule?

    TODO support for multiple concurrent stopwatches / multiple concurrent timers?
      Looks like we're getting back inconsistent intents from the watchface

Add timer support

    DONE? build layout for timer activity
      DONE? activity listed in manifest
      DONE? time picker fragment
        DONE? verify whether Wear 2.0 has a time picker that actually works
	  DONE? "Ok Google, start a 10 minute timer" -- requires an activity?

Lifecyle goodies
    Two sorts of services: NotificationService and *ProviderService; both now will restore state, if necessary
    TODO who actually gets killed when?
    TODO verify that notification update pipeline (which roundtrips with the watchface) actually works

i18n/l10n
    TODO bug friends again for i18n text

Ambient/Always-On
    https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/always-on.html
    TODO detect ambient / etc. modes

"Ok Google" Intents
    DONE? register and deregister for these intents based on whether or not we're set as a complication?


Proguard
    TODO: If this library is passed through proguard optimization, make sure to add the com.google.android.wearable:wearable jar to the list of proguard library jars. Using gradle this can be accomplished by adding the following dependency line:
         dependencies {
             provided 'com.google.android.wearable:wearable:1.0+'
         }
