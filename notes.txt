New design direction: activities are good, notifications are bad!

Finish stopwatch
    DONE? register for clicks from the watchface
    DONE? make the watchface to get an update from us when our state changes

    TODO build layout for stopwatch activity
      TODO activity listed in manifest
      TODO only one at a time: infrastructure to kill the old ones!
  	  TODO "Ok Google, start stopwatch"

    TODO if activity launch still fails, try: METADATA_KEY_PROVIDER_CONFIG_ACTION

Add timer support

    TODO build layout for timer activity
      TODO activity listed in manifest
      TODO time picker fragment
        TODO verify whether Wear 2.0 has a time picker that actually works
	  TODO "Ok Google, start a 10 minute timer" -- requires an activity?

Lifecyle goodies
    Two sorts of services: NotificationService and *ProviderService; both now will restore state, if necessary
    TODO who actually gets killed when?
    TODO verify that notification update pipeline (which roundtrips with the watchface) actually works

i18n/l10n
    TODO bug friends again for i18n text
    TODO RTOL support?

Ambient/Always-On
    https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/always-on.html
    TODO detect ambient / etc. modes
    TODO use alarm manager for 1 Hz updates

Proguard
    TODO: If this library is passed through proguard optimization, make sure to add the com.google.android.wearable:wearable jar to the list of proguard library jars. Using gradle this can be accomplished by adding the following dependency line:
         dependencies {
             provided 'com.google.android.wearable:wearable:1.0+'
         }
