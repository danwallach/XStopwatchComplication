Proguard
    TODO: If this library is passed through proguard optimization, make sure to add the com.google.android.wearable:wearable jar to the list of proguard library jars. Using gradle this can be accomplished by adding the following dependency line:
         dependencies {
             provided 'com.google.android.wearable:wearable:1.0+'
         }
